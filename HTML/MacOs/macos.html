            <h1>The evolution of macOS (and Mac OS X)</h1>

            <h3>Progression of macOs</h3>

            <p>Mac OS has come a long way since System 1.0, and there’s no better way to see just how far we’ve come than to look at screenshots. From the earliest years to the latest versions, it’s a journey that is rather remarkable over three decades of development and refinement.</p>

            <p>Since 2001, Apple has been naming every new release of Mac operating system after animals and famous California’s landmarks. Apart from being creative with names, it also brought lots of major functionality changes.</p>

            <p>The first trial version was called as ‘Kodiak’ which was launched during September 2000. It was the first Apple OS which was given to general public for usage. t marked the first public availability of the Aqua interface, and Apple made many changes to the UI based on customer feedback.</p>

            <p>On March 24, 2001, Apple released the first version of its Mac Os X operating system, noteworthy for its UNIX architecture.</p>

            <p>OS X(now macOS) has been known over the years for it's simplicity, aesthetic interface, advanced technologies, applications, security and accessibility options. From the Finder to Spotlight, the Dock to iCloud, the operating system has been integrated into Apple's hardware, as well as iOS devices, so users can easily work and navigate.</p>

            <p>OSX/macOS has become a brand identity for both Apple and its Mac lineup and has brodadly evolved over the years, even taking some of its shape from Apple's later launch of iOS, its mobile operating system.</p>

            <h1><em>HISTORY</em></h1>

The initial version was slow, incomplete, and had very few applications available at the time of its launch, mostly from independent developers. While many critics suggested that the operating system was not ready for mainstream adoption, they recognized the importance of its initial launch as a base on which to improve. The OS introduced the new Aqua interface which contained title bar with brushed metallic look, bright colored buttons on windows and photo-based icons.
