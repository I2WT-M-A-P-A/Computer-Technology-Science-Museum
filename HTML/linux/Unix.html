            <h1>What is Unix ?</h1>

            <p>UNIX was developed by AT and T Corporation’s Bell Laboratories in the late 1960s as a result of efforts to create a time-sharing computer system. In 1969 a team led by computer scientists Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie created the first version of UNIX on a PDP-7 minicomputer, which was chosen mainly because of Thompson’s familiarity with the system from his hobby work on it. UNIX was quickly adapted for another computer, and the team ported (modified) it to the PDP-11 by late 1970. This would be the first of many ports of UNIX.</p>

            <p>Thompson left Bell Laboratories for a while and taught a course on UNIX at the University of California at Berkeley in the mid-1970s. Students and professors there further enhanced UNIX, eventually creating a version of UNIX called Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD). Work at AT and T also continued, leading to the 1983 release of a new version of UNIX called System V. These versions were later joined by UNIX versions created by Sun Microsystems, Inc., and Silicon Graphics, Inc., among other companies, and continued development kept UNIX on pace with improvements in computer technology. UNIX served as the inspiration for free open-source operating systems such as Linux and FreeBSD, and it is the basis for Apple Inc.’s Mac OS X.</p>

            <p>The main features of UNIX—its portability (the ability to run on many different systems), multitasking and multiuser capabilities, and its extensive library of software—make it as relevant and useful today as it was in 1969.</p>

            <p>Unix is a computer Operating System which is capable of handling activities from multiple users at the same time. The development of Unix started around 1969 at AT and T Bell Labs by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie.</p>

            <p>The Unix operating system is a set of programs that act as a link between the computer and the user. UNIX is widely used for Internet servers, workstations, and mainframe computers.</p>

            <p>The computer programs that allocate the system resources and coordinate all the details of the computer's internals is called the operating system or the kernel.</p>

            <p>Users communicate with the kernel through a program known as the shell. The shell is a command line interpreter; it translates commands entered by the user and converts them into a language that is understood by the kernel.</p>

            <ul>

                <li>Unix was originally developed in 1969 by a group of AT and T employees Ken Thompson, Dennis Ritchie, Douglas McIlroy, and Joe Ossanna at Bell Labs.</li>

                <li>There are various Unix variants available in the market. Solaris Unix, AIX, HP Unix and BSD are a few examples. Linux is also a flavor of Unix which is freely available.</li>

                <li>Several people can use a Unix computer at the same time; hence Unix is called a multiuser system.</li>

                <li>A user can also run multiple programs at the same time; hence Unix is a multitasking environment.</li>


            </ul>

            <h1>Unix Architecture</h1>

            <h2>Here is a basic block diagram of a Unix system:</h2>

            <h3>The main concept that unites all the versions of Unix is the following four basics:</h3>

            <ul>

                <li><p><strong>Kernel</strong> − The kernel is the heart of the operating system. It interacts with the hardware and most of the tasks like memory management, task scheduling and file management.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Shell</strong> − The shell is the utility that processes your requests. When you type in a command at your terminal, the shell interprets the command and calls the program that you want. The shell uses standard syntax for all commands. C Shell, Bourne Shell and Korn Shell are the most famous shells which are available with most of the Unix variants.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Commands and Utilities</strong> − There are various commands and utilities which you can make use of in your day to day activities. <strong>cp, mv, cat</strong> and <strong>grep</strong>, etc. are few examples of commands and utilities. There are over 250 standard commands plus numerous others provided through 3rd party software. All the commands come along with various options.</p></li>

                <li><p><strong>Files and Directories</strong> − All the data of Unix is organized into files. All files are then organized into directories. These directories are further organized into a tree-like structure called the <strong>filesystem.</strong></p></li>

            </ul>
