            <h1>Flash Drives</h1>
            <div id="whatis">
                <h2>What are (usb) flash drives</h2>

                <img src="../../Images/flash-drive-295105_1280.png" alt="Flash drive image" id="polaroid">
                <p >
                    A USB flash drive is a data storage device that includes flash memory with an integrated USB interface.
                    <br>
                    It is typically removable, rewritable and much smaller than an optical disc. Most weigh less than 30 g (1 oz).
                    <br>
                    Since first appearing on the market in late 2000, as with virtually all other computer memory devices, storage capacities have risen while prices have dropped. As of March 2016, flash drives with anywhere from 8 to 256 gigabytes were frequently sold, while 512 GB and 1 terabyte units were less frequent.
                    <br>
                    As of 2018, 2 TB flash drives were the largest available in terms of storage capacity.
                    <br>
                    Some allow up to 100,000 write/erase cycles, depending on the exact type of memory chip used, and are thought to last between 10 and 100 years under normal circumstances.

                <h2>Components</h2>

                <img src="../../Images/Usbkey_internals.jpg" alt="Inside of a usb stick" id="polaroid2">

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Standard-A USB plug – provides a physical interface to the host computer. Some USB flash drives use USB plug that does not protect the 4 contacts, with the possibility of plugging it into the USB port the other way around.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        USB mass storage controller – a small microcontroller with a small amount of on-chip ROM and RAM.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Jumpers and test pins – for testing during the flash drive's manufacturing or loading code into its microcontroller.

                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        NAND flash memory chip(s) – stores data (NAND flash is typically also used in digital cameras and ssds).
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Crystal oscillator – produces the device's main 12 MHz clock signal and controls the device's data output through a phase-locked loop.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Cover (not shown on pic) – typically made of plastic or metal, protecting the electronics against mechanical stress and even possible short circuits.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <h4>A usb flash drive can also have additional compononents such as:</h4>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        LEDs – indicate data transfers or data reads and writes.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Write-protect switches – Enable or disable writing of data into memory.
                    </li>
                    <br>
                    <li>
                        Some drives offer expandable storage via an internal memory card slot, much like a memory card reade
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <h2> Common uses of flash drives</h2>

            <h3>Personal data transport</h3>

            <p>
                The most common use of flash drives is to transport and store personal files, such as documents, pictures and videos.
                <br>
                Individuals also store medical information on flash drives for emergencies and disaster preparation.
            </p>

            <h3>Backup</h3>

            <p>
                Backup must be one of the most common uses of flash drives.
                <br>Since computer viruses/malware are a thing and you can lose your valuable pictures/documents or whatever <br>
                you can have a safety meassure by backing up your data on a flash drive and the process is quite easy.
            </p>

            <h3>Computer forensics and law enforcement</h3>

            <p>
                A recent development for the use of a USB Flash Drive as an application carrier is to carry the Computer Online Forensic Evidence Extractor (COFEE) application developed by Microsoft.
                <br>
                COFEE is a set of applications designed to search for and extract digital evidence on computers confiscated from suspects.
                <br>
                Forensic software is required not to alter, in any way, the information stored on the computer being examined.
                <br>Other forensic suites run from CD-ROM or DVD-ROM, but cannot store data on the media they are run from (although they can write to other attached devices, such as external drives or memory sticks).
            </p>

            <h3>Updating motherboard firmware</h3>

            <p>
                Motherboard firmware (including BIOS and UEFI) can be updated using USB flash drives.
                <br>
                Usually, new firmware image is downloaded and placed onto a FAT16- or FAT32-formatted USB flash drive connected to a system which is to be updated,
                <br>
                and path to the new firmware image is selected within the update component of system's firmware.
                <br>
                Some motherboard manufacturers are also allowing such updates to be performed without the need for entering system's firmware update component, making it possible to easily <br> recover systems with corrupted firmware.
            </p>

            <h3> Operating system installation media</h3>

            <p>
                Installers of some operating systems can be stored to a flash drive instead of a CD or DVD, including various Linux distributions, Windows 7 and newer versions, and macOS.
                <br>
                In particular, Mac OS X 10.7 is distributed only online, through the Mac App Store, or on flash drives; for a MacBook Air with Boot Camp and no external optical drive, <br> a flash drive can be used to run installation of Windows or Linux.
            </p>

            <p>
                However, for installation of Windows 7 and later versions, using USB flash drive with hard disk drive emulation as detected in PC's firmware is recommended in order to boot from it.
                <br>
                Transcend is the only manufacturer of USB flash drives containing such feature.
            </p>

            <p>
                Furthermore, for installation of Windows XP, using USB flash drive with storage limit of at most 2 GB is recommended in order to boot from it.
            </p>

            <h3>Booting operating systems</h3>

            <p>
                Most current PC firmware permits booting from a USB drive, allowing the launch of an operating system from a bootable flash drive.
                <br>
                Such a configuration is known as a Live USB.In other words, a person can have a operating system on a flash drive.
            </p>

            <h2>Security threats</h2>

            <h3>BadUSB</h3>

            <p>
                Flash drives may present a significant security challenge for some organizations.
                <br>
                Their small size and ease of use allows unsupervised visitors or employees to store and smuggle out confidential data with little chance of detection.
                <br>
                Both corporate and public computers are vulnerable to attackers connecting a flash drive to a free USB port and using malicious software such as keyboard loggers or packet sniffers.
            </p>

            <p>
                For computers set up to be bootable from a USB drive, it is possible to use a flash drive containing a bootable portable operating system to access the files of the computer, even if the computer is password protected.
                <br>
                The password can then be changed, or it may be possible to crack the password with a password cracking program and gain full control over the computer.
                <br>
                Encrypting files provides considerable protection against this type of attack.
            </p>

            <p>
                USB flash drives may also be used deliberately or unwittingly to transfer malware and autorun worms onto a network
            </p>

                <h3>USB Killer</h3>
                <img src="../../Images/USBKillerFred.jpg" alt="Usb killer" id="polaroid3">
                <p>
                    In appearance similar to a USB flash drive, a USB killer is a circuit that charges up capacitors to a high voltage using the power supply pins of a USB port then discharges high voltage pulses onto the data pins. <br>
                    This completely standalone device can instantly and permanently damage or destroy any host hardware that it is connected to.
