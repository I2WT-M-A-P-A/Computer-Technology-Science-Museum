        <h1>ENIAC</h1>

        <p>ENIAC, which stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, completed in 1945 and financed by the United States Army, the Ordnance Corps and the Research and Development Command, led by Major General Gladeon M. Barnes. Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory  its first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon. ENIAC had a speed of one thousand times faster than an electromechanical machine. The speed and programmability allowd for thousands more calculations and problems, as it could calclate a trajectory in just 30 seconds that would take a human 20 hours, making 1 ENIAC hour replace 2.400 human hours.

        The total cost of ENIAC was about 487.000 US dolars, which are is equivelent to 7.195.000 US dolars today. They started building it in secret from the public in 1943 at the University of Pennsylvania under the code name "Project PX". The two main desingers were John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert with the help of the desing engineers. Also, a big part of ENIACS development were the women programmers that work on the project. ENIAC was a modular computer which was composed by individual panels to perform various funtions. Some of them were accumulators that the only thing they could do is addition and subtruation. The hight speed of ENIAC was achived because of the panels that had to send and receive numbers, compute them, save the answer and then trigger the next operation without having to move any parts.
