            <h1>ENIAC</h1>

            <p>ENIAC, which stands for Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer was the first programmable, electronic, general-purpose digital computer, completed in 1945 and financed by the United States Army, the Ordnance Corps and the Research and Development Command, led by Major General Gladeon M. Barnes. Although ENIAC was designed and primarily used to calculate artillery firing tables for the United States Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory  its first program was a study of the feasibility of the thermonuclear weapon. ENIAC had a speed of one thousand times faster than an electromechanical machine. The speed and programmability allowd for thousands more calculations and problems, as it could calclate a trajectory in just 30 seconds that would take a human 20 hours, making 1 ENIAC hour replace 2.400 human hours.

                The total cost of ENIAC was about 487.000 US dolars, which are is equivelent to 7.195.000 US dolars today. They started building it in secret from the public in 1943 at the University of Pennsylvania under the code name "Project PX". The two main desingers were John Mauchly and J. Presper Eckert with the help of the desing engineers. Also, a big part of ENIACS development were the women programmers that work on the project. ENIAC was a modular computer which was composed by individual panels to perform various funtions. Some of them were accumulators that the only thing they could do is addition and subtruation. The hight speed of ENIAC was achived because of the panels that had to send and receive numbers, compute them, save the answer and then trigger the next operation without having to move any parts.

                ENIAC had an unprecedented 18,000 vacuum tubes. In order to keep so many of them working at the same time, engineers created strict circuit design guidelines to maximize reliability. They ran extensive tests on components and avoided pushing them to their limits, which included operating vacuum tubes well below their maximum voltages to prolong their life.

                But before 1948, the tubes that ENIAC used burned out almost every day, making it unusable half of the time. It was after 1948 that special hight-reliability tubes were intoduced that allowed for a more practical use. Most of this failures occured during the warm-up and cool-down periods, when both the tube heaters and cathodes were under the most sress.
