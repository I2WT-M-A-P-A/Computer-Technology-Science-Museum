            <h1>GRAPHIC CARDS GPU</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <h4>What is a GPU card?</h4>
            <p>
                A graphics card is a set of the chipset on the circuit board approximately the size of an index card. It converts video data into electronic signals and transmits them to monitor. The monitor acquires the card signals and turns into colorful images. This process happens fast enough to handle games, videos, etc. All electronic things like computers, Laptops, notebooks, and mobiles have some form of the built-in graphics card. We are discussing gaming graphics card of computers. Graphics card is also available for the various propose under different prices.
                How many of you are familiar with the history of Graphic Card? Learn the antiquity of computer graphics card. Let’s get an overview of past.
            </p>

            <h1>History</h1>
            <h2>1940: This is where it all began</h2>

            <p>In the history of graphics card first graphics card used in Saga computer system as the flight simulator 1940 by US military. That graphics card display only 256 colors.</p>

            <h2>Eventful 80’s: The Rise Of Graphics Card</h2>

            <p><strong>In 1981</strong> IBM introduced Monochrome Display Adapter. Arguably not a graphics card, you can assume just a display card.
                <strong>In 1983</strong> Intel released iSBX 275 video graphics card which is a mildly revolutionary device that was capable of displaying eight unique colors resolutions at 256 by 256. That was a big step for the graphics revolution. In 1988 a Canada based company introduced 16 bit, fully 2D VGA card.</p>

            <h2>Eventful 90’s: The Era Of Major Advancements.</h2>
            <p><strong>In 1992</strong> Silicon Graphics Inc (SGI) released OpenGL 1.0, agnostic application programming interface (API) for 2D and 3D both supported the graphics card. Initially, OpenGL aimed at the professional UNIX based businesses. But with developer-friendly support. It moved swiftly adopted for the 3D gaming.
                <strong> In 1998 </strong>The Voodoo2 delivered Voodoo2 3sfx in the market. And that card supports high resolutions 1024 by 768.
                <strong>Finally in 1999</strong> GeForce arrived 256 (DDR version), Nvidia video card, being called a GPU. GeForce supports for DirectX7, and it was capable of processing minimum 10 million polygons per second.</p>

            <h3>1976 - 1995: The Early Days of 3D Consumer Graphics</h3>

            <p>The first true 3D graphics started with early display controllers, known as video shifters and video address generators. They acted as a pass-through between the main processor and the display. The incoming data stream was converted into serial bitmapped video output such as luminance, color, as well as vertical and horizontal composite sync, which kept the line of pixels in a display generation and synchronized each successive line along with the blanking interval (the time between ending one scan line and starting the next).</p>

            <p>A flurry of designs arrived in the latter half of the 1970s, laying the foundation for 3D graphics as we know them. RCA’s “Pixie” video chip (CDP1861) in 1976, for instance, was capable of outputting a NTSC compatible video signal at 62x128 resolution, or 64x32 for the ill-fated RCA Studio II console.The video chip was quickly followed a year later by the Television Interface Adapter (TIA) 1A, which was integrated into the Atari 2600 for generating the screen display, sound effects, and reading input controllers. Development of the TIA was led by Jay Miner, who also led the design of the custom chips for the Commodore Amiga computer later on.</p>

            <h4>After this a lot more consoles graphic cards realeased. But let's talk for the computers.</h4>

            <p>Released in 1995, the Mach64 notched a number of notable firsts. It became the first graphics adapter to be available for PC and Mac computers in the form of the Xclaim ($450 and $650 depending on onboard memory), and, along with S3's Trio, offered full-motion video playback acceleration.The Mach64 also ushered in ATI’s first pro graphics cards, the 3D Pro Turbo and 3D Pro Turbo+PC2TV, priced at a cool $599 for the 2MB option and $899 for the 4MB.</p>

            <p>The following month saw a technology start-up called 3DLabs rise onto the scene, born when DuPont’s Pixel graphics division bought the subsidiary from its parent company, along with the GLINT 300SX processor capable of OpenGL rendering, fragment processing and rasterisation. Due to their high price the company's cards were initially aimed at the professional market. The Fujitsu Sapphire2SX 4MB retailed for $1600-$2000, while an 8MB ELSA GLoria 8 was $2600-$2850. The 300SX, however, was intended for the gaming market.</p>

            <p>The Gaming GLINT 300SX of 1995 featured a much-reduced 2MB of memory. It used 1MB for textures and Z-buffer and the other for frame buffer, but came with an option to increase the VRAM for Direct3D compatibility for another $50 over the $349 base price. The card failed to make headway in an already crowded marketplace, but 3DLabs was already working on a successor in the Permedia series.S3 seemed to be everywhere at that time. The high-end OEM marked was dominated by the company's Trio64 chipsets that integrated DAC, a graphics controller, and clock synthesiser into a single chip. They also utilized a unified frame buffer and supported hardware video overlay (a dedicated portion of graphics memory for rendering video as the application requires). The Trio64 and its 32-bit memory bus sibling, the Trio32, were available as OEM units and standalone cards from vendors such as Diamond, ELSA, Sparkle, STB, Orchid, Hercules and Number Nine. Diamond Multimedia’s prices ranged from $169 for a ViRGE based card, to $569 for a Trio64+ based Diamond Stealth64 Video with 4MB of VRAM.</p>

            <p>After that more progressed cards started coming up but they were all the same with some small exceptions of graphics cards that had extra features  the NV1 which is the first graphics card nvidia released  was the first graphics card with 3D redering.And of cource nvidia started releasing the first generations of graphics cards and continued releasing new genrations until today. Right now we are on the 4th generation of graphics cards .</p>
