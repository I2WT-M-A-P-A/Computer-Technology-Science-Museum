                <h1>A litle about me</h1>

                <p>My name is Polidefkis Gianniotis, though I like to go with the name Pollux, the Latin version of Polidefkis and a nick name that I have come to like. But allas, only a hand few people call me that, which is not all bad, considering I don't know that many people. Mostly the ones that I have come to meet through games or even online. And taking about games and hobbies, do I have a lot to tell you.</p>

                <h2>What I like to do</h2>

                <p>Like most people around my age, which have nothing better to do and are too lazy to actualy work or study, I love to play video games. Could spend hours in them, hours that would propably could be spend doing something productive, like studying, or going out for a walk. And by hours, I literaly mean, hours. Not your typical "I will play for a few hours and then go do something else" kinda thing. More like "I'll be here for a solid 13 hours, lets get this party going". Most people will strongly disagree with that, and I can't blame them. All I know is that trew gaming I have met many cool and awesome people. Some that I have lost contact with, and others that we still talk untill today, hang out, have fun and mess around from time to time, withough having plans to change that. But contacts through the Internet are like a thin peice of glass. Even a sneeze could shatter it. And when it come to games that I like to play the most, I would say I have plade many games, but only some of them have realy captured me and emersed me. The bigest of them being, World Of Warcraft. It's from that game taht I have met those people. I could spend hours talkng about how many hours I have spend playing WoW, and how many games I have played all those years, but as a wise man said in Destiny 2, "I don't have time to explaing why I don't have time to explain"</p>

                <p>Exept from gaming and slowly lossing my eyesight and propably geting back problems, I like to wtach Anime. Now we all now what Anime are, if you don't then my friend, I hope you have a thick skin and an even greater skill at starting a fire. Havng watched many of them in my time, and being a bit pikcy about what I would like to watch, I have come to realise, once your start the third episode, well, you're just to deep to stop a 3 season series with 24 episodes each. Oh, and I also read manga, but only the Attack On Titan one, reading is not one of my streanths. Neither is writing, as you might have realized with your bleeding eyes.</p>

                <p>Other than watching anime and forgeting to take my ADHD medication, I love to hear music. And when I say music, I don't mean that rap and other crap they have nowdays. I like the classics, the 60's-90's songs. Of course from time to time, I just like hearing to some relaxing Jazz and a bit of classical music, just sit back and enjoy the wonders that those people have created. That relaxing and soothing melody, just sit back, close your eyes, and just listen. And of course you have your rock music, metal and the allmight Sabaton. They make great songs about historical events that happened. They do not gloryfy war or conflict, thay just have their own way of leting people hear those events trew music. And they are doing a great job at it.</p>

                <p>Well, that's all you need to know about me, sure there are alot of things to talk about, and for your to not care, but it is what it is. If you feel like you want to know more, or if you have questions about the site, or just why I am the way I am, feel free to do so. Here is my email: pogianniotis@citycollege.sheffield.eu</p>
