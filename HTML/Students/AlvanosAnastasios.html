            <p>Greetings my name is Anastasis I study computer science at city college,university of Sheffield and I am 19 years old. I am one of the team members of M.A.P.A, the team that has created this website.I was responsible for creating the Evolution of GPUs and the MAC OS. On those pages I have added everything about every generation of graphics cards and the same goes for MAC OS on each page the advantages of the new genarations are mentioned as well as the new advances on those technologies.I also helped with the main css page that we created fixing bugs that would appear and helping my colleagues with the overall design.Some interesting things about me I love playing basketball and video games my favorite being Black Desert Online from multiplayer games and Bioshock a single player game there are several Bioshock games I love all of them I even have a figure from a character from that game.My favorite movie is John Wick.Overall I am a social person I also love traveling and exploring other countries.Over those last months I learned so many things on html, css and java script.I love learning new things and I was always interested in computers from a young age.</p>

            <p>Before coming to the university I had a general knowledge about programming only basic things and I am excited to continue improving my skills in programming and other classes that are brand
