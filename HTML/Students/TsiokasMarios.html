            <h1>Who am I</h1>

            <p>
                I am Marios Tsiokas, a undergraduate student at city college, University of Sheffield and I am taking the computer science program.I was born on the 16 of october in 2002 at thessaloniki.
            </p>

            <h2>Why did I choose computer science</h2>

            <p>

                Ever since I was a child I loved computers,laptopts etc. and other electronic gadgets and would mess with them and with the years the more passionate I became for them. Especially in highschool where we were taught programing in python, computer networks and others my interested peaked.And of course because its an interesting field to study.

            </p>

            <h2>Interests</h2>

            <p>
                My interests are probably the usual like other boys in my age.Computer and mobile games, anime and manga/light novels, music, movies etc.<br>
                My favourite computer game is probably SOMA. It's a horror game that shows a nice story and a dilema whether if a copy of yourself is trully you or not.Both the gameplay and the story is very good along with the background sounds which make it way more immersive.
                <br>
                You can find the game here if you are interested: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/282140/SOMA/">https://store.steampowered.com/app/282140/SOMA/</a>
            </p>

            <p> Regarding mobile games, fate/grand order is probably my favourite.It's a game where you can summon historical figures such as (real or not), alexander the great, leonidas, achilles from troy and others, and fight with them by making them stronger.All the characters are voiced acted with exceptional voice actors and the characters' in game art is very well done. And of course it has great main story which can take you from india all the way to an alternate version of olympus.
                <br>
                You can checkout the english version of the game here:<a href="https://fate-go.us/">https://fate-go.us/</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't have a favourite movie but some that I like are ones like, the terminator franchise, "I, Robot", Mortal Engines, and I will most likely enjoy any action packed movie or psychological thrillers.
            </p>

            <p>
                I don't have any specific prefference regarding music.
