            <h3> What is a hard drive</h3>

            A hard disk drive is an electro-mechanical data storage device that stores and retrieves digital data using magnetic storage and one or more rigid rapidly rotating platters coated with magnetic material. The platters are paired with magnetic heads, usually arranged on a moving actuator arm, which read and write data to the platter surfaces. Data is accessed in a random-access manner, meaning that individual blocks of data can be stored and retrieved in any order. HDDs are a type of non-volatile storage, retaining stored data even when powered off.Their speeds are usually arround 5.400 or 7.200 most commonly but they can be as low as 1200 RPM or as high as up to 15000 RPM

            Was created at 1956 by IBM (International Business Machines Corporation) and was the most popular secondary storage devices and still is in a way but it is outclassed by SSDs and NVMEs, but what they do have over them is storage capacity but they lose in terms of speed.That is due to the fact that hard drives are made from actuall mechanical parts (platters, actuator arms etc.)
            <br><br>

            Their storage capacities can very from 500 GBs up to 20 TBs. Nowadays HDDs are mostly used for server use to store huge ammounts of data.

            The hard drives came in all sizes. The first hard drive had the size of approximately 2 refrigerators and could store 3.75 mbs with 24-inch platters.Thats one modern picture.Later on the size of the platters decreased, from 24 to 14 to 10.5 all the way to the most comonnly used nowadays 3.5 and 2.5 inches

            2 Electric motors:

            A spindle motor that spins the disks and an actuator (motor) that positions the read/write head assembly across the spinning disks. The disk motor has an external rotor attached to the disks.Opposite the actuator at the end of the head support arm is the read-write head.The head support arm is very light, but also stiff. In modern drives, acceleration at the head reaches 550 g.
            <br><br>

            The actuator is a permanent magnet and moving coil motor that swings the heads to the desired position. A metal plate supports a squat neodymium-iron-boron (NIB) high-flux magnet.

            The HDD's electronics control the movement of the actuator and the rotation of the disk and perform reads and writes on demand from the disk controller.
