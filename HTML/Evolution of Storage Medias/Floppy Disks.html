            <h1> Floppy Disks</h1>

            <p>
                A floppy disk is a type of disk storage composed of a thin and flexible disk of a magnetic storage medium in a square or nearly square plastic enclosure lined with a fabric that removes dust particles from the spinning disk.It is read and written using a floppy disk drive and was used primarily for data storage as well as for backup and transfering data between computers
            </p>

            <h2> Short History</h2>

            <p>
                In 1967 development began in a IBM facility in San Jose (CA) that led to the world's first floppy disk which was later on in 1972 was pushed on the market in a 8 inch format. Later on in 1976 the more common floppy disk size of arround 5 inches was introduced in 1976 and became almost universal on personal computers and word proccessing systems. The format was then even further reduced to arround 3 inches in 1982 and for a period both 5 and 3 inch sized models were poppular and they remained relevant for arround 40 years before they were dethroned by the new NAND flash technique
            </p>

            <br><br>

            Here you can see an 8,5 and 3 inch model floppy disks side by side<br>

            <h2>Storage sizes</h2>

            <ol>


                <li>The first floppy disk with size of arround 8 inches could store 80 killobytes of data. That today would only be able to store a text file with a few sentences</li>
                <li>The 5 inch model had a size of 360 killobytes. Quite a bit bigger than the 8 inch model but still nowhere near as big as today's standards</li>
                <li>The 3 inch model could store arround 1.5 megabytes</li>
            </ol>

            <h2> How its made</h2>

            <p>
                A floppy disk, like a cassette tape, is made from a thin piece of plastic coated with a magnetic material on both sides. However, it is shaped like a disk rather than a long thin ribbon. The tracks are arranged in concentric rings so that the software can jump from "file 1" to "file 19" without having to fast forward through files 2-18. The diskette spins like a record and the heads move to the correct track, providing what is known as direct access storage.
