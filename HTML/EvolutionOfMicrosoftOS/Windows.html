            <p>Windows XP is considered one of the best Windows versions and it was released in Octomber of 2001. like Windows 2000 it was based in the Windows NT but with the consumer friendly elements of Windows 2000. Visualy diferent, with overhaul upgrades in the Start menu and task bar, having the familiar to all back-ground and the iconinc blue task bar and green Start Button. Windows XP was the longest running Microsoft OS, having three major updates and being supported until April of 2014. Though it had problems with security, even if it had a fire wall.

Windows 7 was a massive improvement form Windows Vista because of the big performance improvement, making it see a major success in sales, both pre-order and release.</p>


            <h1 id="Windows8">Windows 8 And Windows 8.1</h1>

            <p>Windows 8 was released in Octomber of 2012 and it was a massive change for the Windows OS, as it created a whole new interface, without the Start button and menu being pressent. Insteat, it had all the nessesary programmes showing on the screen in order for it to be touch-friendly. It also was faster that any of the previous Windows and it had a USB 3.0 driver support, plus a tab for the new at the time Windows Shop. Thought user were still able to download thirf party programmes, they were not displayed in the main screen. But this new Windows Interface style was not that popular amongs the comunity, as they wanted to have the traditional way of navigation with the mouse and keyboard, but Microsoft wanted to balance it between touch support and desctop users, for many to conisder it a backstep fro the previous version of Windows. It also did not help that there not many touchscreens in use, so it made the whole touch mechanic unecessary.</p>

            <p>Windows 8.1 which was an update from Windows 8, being made in Octomber of 2013, not only it brought back the Start Button along side with the Start Screen, it also allowed users to boot directly to the desktop of Windows 8.1, making it more comfortable to mavigate with a mouse and a kewboard.</p>

            <h3>Development Of Windows 10</h3>

            <p>In December of 2013, Microsoft was working on a new update for the Windows 8, with the name Threshold. They called Threshold a "wave of operating systems" troughout multiple platforms and it was ment to arive at 2015. Their aim was to unite the platform and toolkits for Windows and Xbox One. In April of 2014, they revieled a new version of the Windows 8.1 which inculded a more traditional way of navigating around, replacing the Windows 8 style, going back to the Windows 7 style of interface and start menu.
