            <h1>The birth of the Microsoft Disk Operating System</h1>

            <p>
                MS-DOS, short for Microsoft Disk Operating System, is an operating system the x86-based computers, big part developed by Microsoft and its original writter was Tim Paterson and it was inroduced in August 1981, with it's last update released made in 1994. The operating system was originaly named QDOS, standing for Qucik and Dirty Operating System, before Microsoft purchased exlusive right to sell the system, ranaming it MD-DOS. Starting with Windows NT, the operating systems that Microsoft created were desing independently of MS-DOS, but were capable of runing some MS-DOS applications.

            </p>

            <p>
                Although the system lacked multitasking, multuser capabilities and MS-DOS was limited to a command, it enjoyed enormous popularity  in the 1980s nad early 1990s. It was limited to a command line interface in contrast to the more user friendly GUI. Even after MS-DOS ceased to be marketed as a stand-alone OS, it is still used in some computed systems today.

            <h1>History of the MS-DOS</h1>


            <p>
                MS-DOS's name was originaly named 86-DOS, owned by Seatle Computer Products. The development took only 6 weeks as it was a copy of Digital Research's CP/M (for 808/Z80 processors), made to run on the 8086 processors with an improved disk sector buffering logic and the usage of FIAT12 in the place of CP/M filesystem with the first version shiped out n 1980. Microsoft needed an operating system for the IBM Personal Computer, so they hired Tim Paterson adn at the same time they bought 86-DOS 1.10 for 75.000 US dollars in 1981. In a year the had licenced the MS-DOS to over 70 companies. They desing it so it would run on any 808-family computer, with each having its unique hardware and it's own version of MS-DOS.
