            <h1>Viruses and Malware</h1>

            <h2>What is a virus</h2>


            <p>
                The term "virus" is also misused by extension to refer to other types of malware. "Malware" encompasses computer viruses along with many other forms of malicious software, such as computer "worms", ransomware, spyware, adware, trojan horses, keyloggers, rootkits, bootkits, malicious Browser Helper Object (BHOs), and other malicious software. 
                <br>
                The majority of active malware threats are trojan horse programs or computer worms rather than computer viruses. The term computer virus, coined by Fred Cohen in 1985, is a misnomer.
                <br>
                Viruses often perform some type of harmful activity on infected host computers, such as acquisition of hard disk space or central processing unit (CPU) time, accessing and stealing private information (e.g. email addresses, passwords, bank information etc.), corrupti ng data, displaying political, humorous or threatening messages on the user's screen, spamming their e-mail contacts, logging their keystrokes, or even rendering the computer useless. 
                <br>
                However, not all viruses carry a destructive "payload" and attempt to hide themselves—the defining characteristic of viruses is that they are self-replicating computer programs that modify other software without user consent by injecting themselves into the said programs, similar to a biological virus which replicates within living cells

            <h2>Brain boot sector virus</h2>

            <h3>What is the brain boot sector virus</h3>

            <p>
                Brain, the first PC virus, began infecting 5.2" floppy disks in 1986. As Securelist reports, it was the work of two brothers, Basit and Amjad Farooq Alvi, who ran a computer store in Pakistan.
                <br>
                Tired of customers making illegal copies of their software, they developed Brain, which replaced the boot sector of a floppy disk with a virus. The virus, which was also the first stealth virus, contained a hidden copyright message, but did not actually corrupt any data. The disk label is usually changed to ©Brain, and the following text can be seen in infected boot sectors:
            </p>

            <p>
                Welcome to the Dungeon (c) 1986 Amjads (pvt) Ltd VIRUS_SHOE RECORD V9.0 Dedicated to the dynamic memories of millions of viruses who are no longer with us today - Thanks GOODNESS!!! BEWARE OF THE er..VIRUS : this program is catching program follows after these messages....$#@%$@!!
            </p>

            <p>
                There are many minor and major variations to that version of the text. The virus slows down the floppy disk drive and makes seven kilobytes of memory unavailable to DOS
            </p>

            <p>
                Brain lacks code for dealing with hard disk partitioning, and avoids infecting hard disks by checking the most significant bit of the BIOS drive number being accessed. Brain does not infect the disk if the bit is clear, unlike other viruses at the time, which paid no attention to disk partitioning and consequently destroyed data stored on hard disks by treating them in the same way as floppy disks. Brain often went undetected, partially due to this deliberate non-destructiveness, especially when the user paid little to no attention to the low speed of floppy disk access
            </p>

            <p>
                The virus came complete with the brothers' address and three phone numbers, and a message that told the user that their machine was infected and to call them for inoculation: <br><br>

            <h2>The Melissa virus</h2>

            <p>
                In late March 1999, a programmer named David Lee Smith hijacked an America Online (AOL) account and used it to post a file on an Internet newsgroup named “alt.sex.” The posting promised dozens of free passwords to fee-based websites with adult content. When users took the bait, downloading the document and then opening it with Microsoft Word, a virus was unleashed on their computers.
                On March 26, it began spreading like wildfire across the Internet.

            </p>


            <h3>Damage dealt</h3>

            <p>
                The virus was not intended to steal money or information, but it wreaked plenty of havoc nonetheless. Email servers at more than 300 corporations and government agencies worldwide became overloaded, and some had to be shut down entirely, including at Microsoft. Approximately one million email accounts were disrupted, and Internet traffic in some locations slowed to a crawl.
            </p>

            <h3>The culprit</h3>

            <p>
                Finding the culprit didn’t take long, thanks to a tip from a representative of AOL and nearly seamless cooperation between the FBI, New Jersey law enforcement, and other partners. Authorities traced the electronic fingerprints of the virus to Smith, who was arrested in northeastern New Jersey on April 1, 1999. Smith pleaded guilty in December 1999, and in May 2002, he was sentenced to 20 months in federal prison and fined $5,000. He also agreed to cooperate with federal and state authorities.
            </p>

            <h3>Aftermath</h3>

            <p>
                Like the Morris worm just over a decade earlier, the Melissa virus was a double-edged sword, leading to enhancements in online security while serving as inspiration for a wave of even more costly and potent cyberattacks to come.
            </p>

            <h2> ILOVEYOU virus</h2>

            <h3>What is the ILOVEYOU virus</h3>

            <p>
                The ILOVEYOU virus comes in an e-mail note with "I LOVE YOU" in the subject line and contains an attachment that, when opened, results in the message being re-sent to everyone in the recipient's Microsoft Outlook address book and, perhaps more seriously, the loss of every JPEG, MP3, and certain other files on the recipient's hard disk. Because Microsoft Outlook is widely installed as the e-mail handler in corporate networks, the ILOVEYOU virus can spread rapidly from user to user within a corporation. On May 4, 2000, the virus spread so quickly that e-mail had to be shut down in a number of major enterprises such as the Ford Motor Company. The virus reached an estimated 45 million users in a single day.
            </p>

            <h3>How it works</h3>

            <p>
                The attachment in the ILOVEYOU virus is a VBScript program that, when opened, finds the recipient's Outlook address book and re-sends the note to everyone in it. It then overwrites (and thus destroys) all files of the following file types: JPEG, MP3, VPOS, JS, JSE, CSS, WSH, SCT and HTA. Users who don't have a backup copy will have lost these files.
                <br><br>
                The ILOVEYOU virus also resets the recipient's Internet Explorer start page in a way that may cause further trouble, resets certain Windows registry settings, and also acts to spread itself through Internet Relay Chat (Internet Relay Chat).
            </p>

            <p>
                One of the first steps companies used to ward off the ILOVEYOU virus was to screen out notes with ILOVEYOU in the subject line. However, hackers quickly introduced copycat variations with subject lines variously identifying "JOKE" and "Mother's Day!" as the content, but containing the same or similar VBScript code. At least 12 variations have been identified. The most sinister mutation is undoubtedly the one with the subject line containing "VIRUS ALERT!!!" Posing as a virus fix from Symantec, the note starts out with "Dear Symantec Customer." The attachment (which should not be opened) is "protect.vbs." 
            </p>

            <p>
                A brief comparison, the previously explained Melissa virus sent copies to the first 50 contacts on the address book but the ILOVEYOU virus sent out emails to all email addresses in the Windows Address Book. As a result, the ILOVEYOU virus spread much faster than any other previous email worm.
            </p>

            <h4>Fun fact:The ILOVEYOU virus was set free in the wild from the Philipines very soon after the Melissa virus issue was settled.</h4>

            <h2>Zeus</h2>

            <h3>What is Zeus</h3>

            <p>
                Zeus Virus (or Zeus Trojan malware) is a form of malicious software that targets Microsoft Windows and is often used to steal financial data. First detected in 2007, the Zeus Trojan, which is often called Zbot, has become one of the most successful pieces of botnet software in the world, afflicting millions of machines and spawning a host of similar pieces of malware built off of its code. While the threat posed by Zeus dwindled when its creator reportedly retired in 2010, a number of variants showed up on the scene when the source code became public, making this particular malware relevant and dangerous once again
            </p>

            <h3>How it works</h3>

            <p>
                The Zeus Virus can do a number of nasty things once it infects a computer, but it really has two major pieces of functionality.
                <br><br>
                First, it creates a botnet, which is a network of corrupted machines that are covertly controlled by a command and control server under the control of the malware's owner. A botnet allows the owner to collect massive amounts of information or execute large-scale attacks.
                <br><br>
                Zeus also acts as a financial services Trojan designed to steal banking credentials from the machines it infects. 
                <br>
                It accomplishes this through website monitoring and keylogging, where the malware recognizes when the user is on a banking website and records the keystrokes used to log in.
                <br>
                This means that the Trojan can get around the security in place on these websites, as the keystrokes required for logging in are recorded as the user enters them

                The Zeus Virus has two main methods of infection:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Spam messages</li>
                <li>Drive-by downloads</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The spam messages often come in the form of email, but there have been social media campaigns designed to spread the malware through messages and postings on social media sites.
                <br>
                Once users click on a link in the email or message, they are directed to a website that automatically installs the malware. 
                <br>
                Because the malware is adept at stealing login credentials, it can sometimes be configured to steal email and social media credentials, enabling the botnet to spam messages from trusted sources and greatly expand its range.
                <br>

                Drive-by downloads happen when the hackers are able to corrupt legitimate websites, inserting their malicious code into a website that the user trusts. 
                <br>
                The malware then installs itself when the user visits the website or when the user downloads and installs a benign program
            </p>

            <h3>Damage dealt</h3>
            <p>
                The initial impact when the malware started its infiltration affected more than 3.6 million PCs in the United States causing over $70 million in damages. Anyone using a Windows PC can fall victim to the Zeus virus, even with up-to-date antivirus, it can be near impossible to detect.
