            <h1> Computer Worms</h1>



            <h2>What is a computer worm</h2>

            <p>
                A computer worm is a standalone malware computer program that replicates itself in order to spread to other computers It often uses a computer network to spread itself, relying on security failures on the target computer to access it. 
                <br>
                It will use this machine as a host to scan and infect other computers. 
                <br>
                When these new worm-invaded computers are controlled, the worm will continue to scan and infect other computers using these computers as hosts, and this behavior will continue.
                <br>
                Computer worms use recursive method to copy themselves without host program and distribute themselves based on the law of exponential growth, and then controlling and infecting more and more computers in a short time.
                <br>
                Worms almost always cause at least some harm to the network, even if only by consuming bandwidth, whereas viruses almost always corrupt or modify files on a targeted computer.
            </p>

            <p>
                Many worms are designed only to spread, and do not attempt to change the systems they pass through. However, as the Morris worm that you will see, even these "payload-free" 
                <br>worms can cause major disruption by increasing network traffic and other unintended effects.
            </p>

            <h2>The moris worm</h2>

            <h3>What is the moris worm</h3>

            <p>
                The Morris Worm, sometimes also called the Internet Worm, entered the history books as the first computer worm that was distributed over the Internet and that compromised thousands of computers, drawing massive media attention in the process.
                <br>
                It was written and unleashed in 1988 by Robert Tappan Morris, a 23-year-old doctoral student at Cornell University and the son of Robert Morris Sr., a famous cryptographer and formerly the chief scientist at the NSA’s National Computer Security Center.
            </p>

            <p>
                Though Morris did not intend for the worm to be actively destructive, instead seeking to merely highlight the weaknesses present in many networks of the time, an unintentional consequence of Morris' coding resulted in 
                <br>
                the worm being more damaging and easily spread than originally planned; programmed to check each computer to determine if the infection was already present, Morris, believing that some system administrators might counter this by instructing the computer to report a false positive, programmed the worm to copy itself 14% of the time, regardless of the status of infection on the computer. This resulted in a computer potentially being infected multiple times, with each additional infection slowing the machine down to the eventual point of being unusable. This would have the same effect as a fork bomb, and crash the computer several times.
            </p>

            <h3>Damage done</h3>

            <p>
                The worm only targeted computers running a specific version of the Unix operating system, but it spread widely because it featured multiple vectors of attack. For example, it exploited a backdoor in the Internet’s electronic mail system and a bug in the “finger” program that identified network users. It was also designed to stay hidden
            </p>

            <p>
                The worm did not damage or destroy files, but it still packed a punch. Vital military and university functions slowed to a crawl. Emails were delayed for days. The network community labored to figure out how the worm worked and how to remove it. Some institutions wiped their systems; others disconnected their computers from the network for as long as a week. The exact damages were difficult to quantify, but estimates started at $100,000 and soared into the millions.
            </p>

            <p>
                As computer experts worked feverishly on a fix, the question of who was responsible became more urgent. Shortly after the attack, a dismayed programmer contacted two friends, admitting he’d launched the worm and despairing that it had spiraled dangerously out of control. He asked one friend to relay an anonymous message across the Internet on his behalf, with a brief apology and guidance for removing the program. Ironically, few received the message in time because the network had been so damaged by the worm. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The worm was created by Morris simply to see if it could be done, and was released from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in the hope of suggesting that its creator studied there, instead of Cornell.
            </p>

            <h3>Aftermath</h3>

            <p>
                Besides the damage that it caused, the worm also exposed many security weaknesses, revealing the need for reviewing password protection procedures, among other measures
            </p>

            <p>
                The worm’s creator became the first person to be convicted under the then recent Computer Fraud and Abuse Act. He was sentenced to three years of probation and ordered to pay a $10,050 fine and to perform 400 hours of community service.
            </p>
            <p>

            <h2>Code red</h2>

            <h3>What is code red</h3>

            <p>Code Red was a computer worm observed on the Internet on July 15, 2001. It attacked computers running Microsoft's IIS web server.</p>

            <p>
                The Code Red worm was first discovered and researched by eEye Digital Security employees Marc Maiffret and Ryan Permeh, the Code Red worm exploited a vulnerability discovered by Riley Hassell. They named it "Code Red" because Code Red Mountain Dew was what they were drinking at the time.

                Although the worm had been released on July 13, the largest group of infected computers was seen on July 19, 2001. On this day, the number of infected hosts reached 359,000.
            </p>

            <h3>Damage caused</h3>

            <p>
                CodeRed is a worm that caused possible billions of dollars of damage in the summer of 2001. It contains the text string "Hacked by Chinese!", which is displayed on web pages that the worm defaces. It is also one of the few worms able to run entirely in memory, leaving no files on the hard drive or any other permanent storage (although some variants do).
            </p>

            <h2>Father christmass</h2>

            <h3>What is the "Father Christmas" worm</h3>

            <p>
                Father Christmas was an early worm that had a run through the early DECNet Internet only a few days before Christmas in 1988. It appeared less than two months after the Morris worm.
            </p>

            <h3>How it worked</h3>

            <p>
                The worm, a file named HI.COM, copies itself from one DECNET node to another.
                <br>
                The worm on the infecting node attempts to run the copy of itself on the target node, either by Task Object 0, a program that allows task-to-task jobs to be run between two computer systems, or by using DECNET as both a username and password.
                <br>
                If it is unable to run the copy on the target system, it will delete the HI.COM file on the target system.
                <br>
                If the infection is successful, HI.COM will load into the memory. 
                It will use the process name MAIL_178DC and delete the HI.COM file. 
                <br>
                The worm then sends a SYS$ANNOUNCE banner to 20597::PHSOLIDE. The worm then checks the system clock. 
                <br>
                If the date is past 1988.12.24 at 00:00 and before 00:30, it creates a list of all users on the system sends an email to them. If it is past 00:30, the worm will simply stop executing.
            </p>

            <h3>Damage done</h3>

            <p>
                The worm was only able to execute on a few systems.
                <br>
                About 6,000 systems were reported to have received the HI.COM file, but less than 2% actually executed the the worm.
            </p>

            <h2> MSBlast</h2>

            <h3>What is MSBlast</h3>

            <p>
                Blaster Worm (also known as Lovsan, Lovesan, or MSBlast) was a computer worm that spread on computers running operating systems Windows XP and Windows 2000 during August 2003.
                <br>
                The worm was first noticed and started spreading on August 11, 2003. The rate that it spread increased until the number of infections peaked on August 13, 2003.
                <br>
                Once a network (such as a company or university) was infected, it spread more quickly within the network because firewalls typically did not prevent internal machines from using a certain port.
                <br>
                Filtering by ISPs and widespread publicity about the worm curbed the spread of Blaster.
            </p>

            <h3>How it works</h3>

            <p>
                MSBlast does not spread via email. Instead, it scans the Internet on port 135 looking for vulnerable computers. When it finds one, it attempts to exploit the DCOM RPC buffer overflow, create a remote root shell on TCP port 4444, then use FTP to download a file called msblast.exe onto the infected computer.
            </p>

            <h3>Damage done</h3>

            <p>
                The Blaster Worm used the affected computers as a propagation medium to spread the virus to other machines. The blaster worm is considered to be one of several high-profile worms that impacted the Microsoft platform on a large scale in 2003. Many security specialists rated that year as one of the worst ever for viral threats, which posed huge security risks for Internet users.
